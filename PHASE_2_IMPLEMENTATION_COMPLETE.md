## üîß Manual Implementation Required

### 1. **Install Dependencies** [5 minutes]
```bash
npm install react-native-purchases@^8.11.5
cd ios && pod install  # For iOS
```

### 2. **Environment Variables** [2 minutes]
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUE_CAT_IOS_API_KEY=your_ios_api_key_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUE_CAT_ANDROID_API_KEY=your_android_api_key_here
```

### 3. **Database Migration** [5 minutes]
Run the migration files in Supabase:
```bash
# Apply the subscription management schema
supabase db reset --linked
# Or manually run the SQL files:
# - supabase/migrations/20250125120000_subscription_management.sql
# - supabase/migrations/20250125120001_subscription_functions.sql
```

### 4. **Deploy Edge Function** [5 minutes]
```bash
supabase functions deploy revenue-cat-webhook --project-ref your-project-ref
```

### 5. **RevenueCat Dashboard Setup** [20 minutes]

#### 5.1 Create RevenueCat Account
1. Go to [RevenueCat Dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com)
2. Create account and new project
3. Get API keys from Settings > API Keys

#### 5.2 Configure Products
Create these products in RevenueCat:
- **Product ID**: `premium_monthly`
- **Price**: $4.99/month
- **Type**: Auto-renewable subscription

- **Product ID**: `premium_annual`
- **Price**: $39.99/year
- **Type**: Auto-renewable subscription

#### 5.3 Create Entitlements
- **Entitlement ID**: `premium`
- **Attached Products**: `premium_monthly`, `premium_annual`

#### 5.4 Set Up Webhook
Configure webhook in RevenueCat:
- **URL**: `https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/revenue-cat-webhook`
- **Events**: `INITIAL_PURCHASE`, `RENEWAL`, `CANCELLATION`, `EXPIRATION`, `BILLING_ISSUE`

### 6. **App Store Configuration** [30-60 minutes]

#### 6.1 iOS App Store Connect
1. Create in-app purchase products:
   - Product ID: `premium_monthly`
   - Type: Auto-renewable subscription
   - Pricing: $4.99/month
   
   - Product ID: `premium_annual`
   - Type: Auto-renewable subscription
   - Pricing: $39.99/year
2. Configure subscription groups (both products in same group)
3. Submit for review

#### 6.2 Google Play Console (if Android)

**No app.json changes needed!** 

React Native Purchases works with Expo managed workflow without requiring a config plugin. The package will be automatically configured when you install it and run the app.

#### 7.2 iOS Permissions (if needed)
The app should already have necessary permissions, but verify in `ios/Taily/Info.plist` if any subscription-related permissions are needed.

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Testing [10 minutes]
1. **Build and run app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test paywall triggers**:
   - Generate 3rd AI story (should show paywall)
   - Try audio generation as free user (should show paywall)
   - Read story beyond 20% (should show paywall)
3. **Verify UI components**:
   - PaywallTrigger displays correctly
   - PaywallScreen navigation works
   - Usage indicators show correct limits

### Phase 2: Subscription Flow Testing [20 minutes]
1. **Test purchase flow** (use sandbox/test accounts)
2. **Verify subscription sync** to Supabase
3. **Test feature unlocking** after purchase
4. **Test subscription expiry** handling

### Phase 3: Edge Cases [15 minutes]
1. **Network connectivity** during purchase
2. **App backgrounding** during purchase
3. **Subscription restoration**
4. **Multiple device sync**

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **RevenueCat initialization fails**
   - Verify API keys in environment variables
   - Check if `react-native-purchases` is properly linked

2. **Paywall doesn't appear**
   - Check subscription service is properly imported
   - Verify user is authenticated
   - Check console for subscription check errors

3. **Subscription status doesn't sync**
   - Verify webhook URL is correctly configured
   - Check edge function logs in Supabase
   - Ensure RevenueCat customer ID matches user ID

4. **Database migration fails**
   - Check if tables already exist
   - Verify RLS policies are not conflicting
   - Ensure user has proper database permissions

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check edge function logs
supabase functions logs revenue-cat-webhook

# Test webhook locally
supabase functions serve revenue-cat-webhook

# Reset database (development only)
supabase db reset --linked
```

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

After completing the manual setup:

1. **Free users** can generate 2 AI stories (lifetime), read 20% of stories, no audio access
2. **Premium users** get 2 AI stories daily, full reading access, 2 audio generations monthly
3. **Paywall conversion** rate should be 3-8% (industry standard for freemium apps)
4. **Revenue tracking** via RevenueCat analytics
5. **User experience** remains smooth with non-intrusive monetization

## üìà Future Enhancements

### ‚úÖ **Annual Subscription Strategy (NEWLY IMPLEMENTED)**
- **33% savings**: Annual plan at $39.99/year vs $59.88 for monthly
- **Default selection**: Annual plan pre-selected to maximize user lifetime value
- **Clear value prop**: "$3.33/month" messaging emphasizes the savings
- **UI optimization**: Side-by-side comparison with savings badge
- **Conversion boost**: Annual subscriptions typically increase LTV by 3-5x

### Potential Future Additions (not yet implemented):
- **Free trial** (7 days premium)
- **Family sharing** support
- **Usage analytics** dashboard
- **A/B testing** for paywall messaging
- **Promotional codes** support

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for a freemium subscription model that can be extended with these features as needed.
